# HoloHealth

A new way for doctors to access their patient's data. Made at MHacks X.

## Why

Doctors and nurses spend lots of time managing paperwork and navigating the intricate databases present in our healthcare system. HoloHealth aims to free up that time by allowing doctors to see a patient's data in front of them using Mixed Reality. 

## How

Using the Hololens, the app scans a QR code to get a patient ID that is then passed to AthenHealth to get all the relevant data.
